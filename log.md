# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 7, Monday

**Today's Progress**: 

Did chapter on randomness in the Book of Shaders. https://thebookofshaders.com/10/

**Thoughts** 

Not comfortable with coming up with my own ideas to implet in shaders yet. Really just in the phase of following tutorials. That is where it is at. But that is okay. 

### Day 2: February 8, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Did some more exploration with truchet tiling today. 

**Thoughts** 

I'm ready to move on to the next thing tomorrow. I've tried to recreate some things from Pinterest with some success. Simple things though.
